## Env Setup
To have the DeepMind Lab environment available, we need to build a local python package & then use that package in our 
project.

** Must have a global python ready and available

1. Follow the steps in from [deepmindlab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab/blob/master/python/pip_package/README.md).
   2. This requires installing Bazel which can be done through this [link](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk).

**We must be careful with all this once we start doing it in a docker to launch the jobs**

TODO: Add the locally built package to the setup steps as a pip install
